# YoutubeNotInterested
Script / tool to bulk mark video suggestions as 'not interested'.


Completely fed up with the asinine 'suggestions' which have been making and the fact that even if you mark a channel as 'don't recommend this channel' - they do anyway, I wrote this script. It marks all of the current suggested videos as not interested.

Hit F12, go to Console, copy/paste the script and run. Enjoy.

TODO
* Write a method to detect if a channel is on the block list, and mark as 'do not recommend channel'
* Create a Chrome plugin to:
  ** obviate the need for opening the dev tools.
  ** block videos containing keywords on a list from loading in the first place.
